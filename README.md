# BATTLESHIP 

Welcome to our Battleship Game !!!

Choose your coordinates, place your ships on the board, and play against the
computer in this terminal-based adaptation of the classic board game from the
1930's. This game became popular with French and Russian soldiers during World War I.

We created this game using Ruby language as a paired project assignment in the First Module of
Turing School of Software and Design.

## Tested using RSpec 

You can test any rspec file on the command line `rspec spec/file_name.rb`

## We hope you enjoy playing this as much as we enjoyed making it!
