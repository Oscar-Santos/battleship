## BATTLESHIP ##

Welcome to our game Battleship!!!

Choose your coordinates, place your ships on the board, and play against the
computer in this terminal-based adaptation of the classic board game from the
1930's, that became popular with French and Russian soldiers during World War I.

We created this game as a paired project assignment in the First Module of
Turing School of Software and Design.
