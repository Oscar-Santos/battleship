# BATTLESHIP 

Welcome to our Battleship Game !!!

Choose your coordinates, place your ships on the board, and play against the
computer in this terminal-based adaptation of the classic board game from the
1930's. This game became popular with French and Russian soldiers during World War I.

We created this game as a paired project assignment in the First Module of
Turing School of Software and Design.


## HOW TO PLAY 🚢

Run the Battleship Runner file in your terminal with the command:

`ruby battleship_runner.rb`

Then follow the prompts!
